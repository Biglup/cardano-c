JSON
==========================

JavaScript Object Notation (`JSON`_) is a text-based data serialization format that is widely used for its simplicity and readability. JSON's design is particularly suited for applications where human-readable structured data is required, making it a preferred choice for data interchange and configuration formats.

This section of the documentation provides detailed information on each function offered by this library to both generate and parse `JSON`_ encoded data:
