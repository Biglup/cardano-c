Witness Set
============

A witness is a piece of information that allows you to efficiently verify the authenticity of the transaction (also known as proof).

In Cardano, transactions have multiple types of authentication proofs, these can range from signatures for spending UTxOs, to scripts (with its arguments, datums and redeemers) for smart contract execution.
