Protocol Parameters
===================

This section of the documentation introduces the protocol parameters related types within the Cardano ecosystem.

Protocol parameters on Cardano are the various settings that define the blockchain's behavior. Some protocol parameters are stable and non-updatable while others can be adjusted to adapt to changing conditions over time.

Examples of important Cardano protocol parameters include the maximum block size, the transaction fee structure, the block production schedule, and the minimum ada balance required for staking (read more in the following sections). Parameter choices can have a significant impact on the network's performance, security, and usability, and their alteration must be carefully considered.
