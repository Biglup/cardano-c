Pool Parameters
================

Pool parameters in Cardano define the configuration and characteristics of a staking pool, which is an essential component of the network's proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.

These parameters include details such as the operator's key hash, the pledge amount (the amount of ADA staked by the pool operator), operational costs, margin, reward account, pool owners, relays, and metadata.

Together, these parameters govern how the staking pool operates, distributes rewards, and interacts with other nodes in the Cardano network.
